This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe#project-solution) curriculum.

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns clicking on the grid.
3. The first player to get **three in a row** wins!
